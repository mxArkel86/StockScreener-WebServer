                "ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES Unaudited Interim Financial Information We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for interim financial reporting. These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, in our opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated cash flows, operating results, and balance sheets for the periods presented. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for 2022 due to seasonal and other factors. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Common Stock Split On May 27, 2022, we effected a 20-for-1 stock split of our common stock and proportionately increased the number of authorized shares of common stock. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”), and per share or per RSU information throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a par value of $0.01 per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split was reclassified from “Additional paid-in capital” to “Common stock.” Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the “Company”), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating leases, and valuation and impairment of investments. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2022 we changed our estimate of the useful lives for our servers from four five Property and equipment, net Property and equipment, net Supplemental Cash Flow Information The following table shows supplemental cash flow information (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Twelve Months Ended 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION: Cash paid for interest on debt $ 276 $ 304 $ 731 $ 932 $ 933 $ 1,299 Cash paid for operating leases 1,812 1,813 5,029 6,268 6,230 7,961 Cash paid for interest on finance leases 121 88 407 290 535 404 Cash paid for interest on financing obligations 48 39 116 152 147 189 Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds 750 742 3,354 4,340 3,774 4,674 Assets acquired under operating leases 10,447 6,755 19,561 14,031 23,908 19,839 Property and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and modifications 1,744 131 5,453 358 8,149 1,966 Property and equipment recognized during the construction period of build-to-suit lease arrangements 1,797 526 3,877 2,877 4,916 4,847 Property and equipment derecognized after the construction period of build-to-suit lease arrangements, with the associated leases recognized as operating 76 2,195 174 3,307 174 3,363 Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect. The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended 2021 2022 2021 2022 Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 10,132 10,191 10,103 10,178 Total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 177 140 184 — Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 10,309 10,331 10,287 10,178 Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, is as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended 2021 2022 2021 2022 Marketable equity securities valuation gains (losses) $ (129) $ 1,039 $ (48) $ (11,528) Equity warrant valuation gains (losses) (50) (170) 1,194 (1,606) Upward adjustments relating to equity investments in private companies 155 11 1,661 76 Foreign currency gains (losses) (107) (103) (28) (206) Other, net (32) (18) 16 (92) Total other income (expense), net (163) 759 2,795 (13,356) Included in other income (expense), net is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $1.1 billion in Q3 2022, and $(10.4) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, from our equity investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (“Rivian”). Our investment in Rivian’s preferred stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, prior to Rivian’s initial public offering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock to Class A common stock. As of September 30, 2022, we held 158 million shares of Rivian’s Class A common stock, representing an approximate 17% ownership interest, and an approximate 16% voting interest. We determined that we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles, and one of our employees serving on Rivian’s board of directors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian, which is included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets. Required summarized financial information of Rivian as disclosed in its most recent SEC filings is as follows (in millions): Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2022 Revenues $ — $ 459 Gross profit — (1,206) Loss from operations (990) (3,287) Net loss (994) (3,305) Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a write-down of inventory, was $2.6 billion and $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022. Accounts Receivable, Net and Other Included in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, customer receivables, net, were $20.2 billion and $22.8 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $5.3 billion and $4.9 billion, and seller receivables, net, were $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory. We estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022. Digital Video and Music Content The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022 were $10.7 billion and $16.3 billion. Total video and music expense was $3.3 billion and $4.2 billion in Q3 2021 and Q3 2022, and $9.4 billion and $11.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $14.0 billion, of which $10.1 billion was recognized as revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $2.2 billion and $2.7 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022. Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our consolidated financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $104.3 billion as of September 30, 2022. The weighted-average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.8 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term. Acquisition Activity On March 17, 2022, we acquired MGM Holdings Inc. (“MGM”), for cash consideration of approximately $6.1 billion, net of cash acquired, to provide more digital media content options for customers. We also assumed $2.5 billion of debt, which we repaid immediately after closing. The acquired assets primarily consist of $3.4 billion of video content and $4.9 billion of goodwill, the majority of which is allocated to our North America segment. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the MGM acquisition were not material to our consolidated results of operations. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not significant."

To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value: Level 1— Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. Level 2— Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3— Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. We measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022. The following table summarizes, by major security type, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in millions): December 31, 2021 September 30, 2022 Total Cost or Gross Gross Total Cash $ 10,942 $ 10,720 $ — $ — $ 10,720 Level 1 securities: Money market funds 20,312 16,697 — — 16,697 Equity securities (1)(3) 1,646 5,988 Level 2 securities: Foreign government and agency securities 181 141 — (2) 139 U.S. government and agency securities 4,300 2,301 — (169) 2,132 Corporate debt securities 35,764 20,229 — (799) 19,430 Asset-backed securities 6,738 3,578 — (191) 3,387 Other fixed income securities 686 403 — (22) 381 Equity securities (1)(3) 15,740 19 $ 96,309 $ 54,069 $ — $ (1,183) $ 58,893 Less: Restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (2) (260) (231) Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 96,049 $ 58,662 ___________________ (1) The related unrealized gain (loss) recorded in “Other income (expense), net” was $(116) million and $1.0 billion in Q3 2021 and Q3 2022, and $6 million and $(11.3) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022. (2) We are required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable fixed income securities primarily as collateral for real estate, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. We classify cash, cash equivalents, and marketable fixed income securities with use restrictions of less than twelve months as “Accounts receivable, net and other” and of twelve months or longer as non-current “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. See “Note 4 — Commitments and Contingencies.” (3) Our equity investment in Rivian had a fair value of $15.6 billion and $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, respectively. The investment was subject to regulatory sales restrictions resulting in a discount for lack of marketability of approximately $800 million as of December 31, 2021, which expired in Q1 2022. The following table summarizes the remaining contractual maturities of our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities as of September 30, 2022 (in millions): Amortized Estimated Due within one year $ 26,797 $ 26,738 Due after one year through five years 13,757 12,807 Due after five years through ten years 772 728 Due after ten years 2,023 1,893 Total $ 43,349 $ 42,166 Actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities because borrowers may have certain prepayment conditions. Equity Warrants and Non-Marketable Equity Investments We hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, these warrants had a fair value of $3.4 billion and $2.5 billion, and are recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets with gains and losses recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are primarily classified as Level 2 assets. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, equity investments not accounted for under the equity-method and without readily determinable fair values had a carrying value of $603 million and $831 million, and are recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets with adjustments recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Reconciliation The following table provides a reconciliation of the amount of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets to the total of the same such amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions): December 31, 2021 September 30, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 36,220 $ 34,947 Restricted cash included in accounts receivable, net and other 242 224 Restricted cash included in other assets 15 7 Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows $ 36,477 $ 35,178 "

The combined weighted-average remaining life of the Notes was 14.0 years as of September 30, 2022. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $53.3 billion and $53.7 billion as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates. We have a $1.5 billion secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which we increased from $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion in August 2022 and we may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is available until August 2025, bears interest based on the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25%, and has a commitment fee of up to 0.45% on the undrawn portion. There were $803 million and $1.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, which had a weighted-average interest rate of 2.7%. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, we have pledged $918 million and $1.2 billion of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022. We have U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper programs (the “Commercial Paper Programs”) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $20.0 billion (including up to €3.0 billion) at the date of issue, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. In March 2022, we increased the size of the Commercial Paper Programs from $10.0 billion to $20.0 billion. There were $725 million and $11.7 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, which were included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets and had a weighted-average effective interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.08% and 2.54%, respectively. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes."

We repurchased 46.2 million shares of our common stock for $6.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 under these programs. As of September 30, 2022, we have $6.1 billion remaining under the repurchase program. Stock Award Activity Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 10.5 billion and 10.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022.

                "INCOME TAXES Our tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment. Our quarterly tax provision, and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate, is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, developments in tax controversies, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions. For 2022, we estimate that our effective tax rate will be favorably impacted by the U.S. federal research and development credit. In addition, valuation gains and losses from our equity investment in Rivian impact our pre-tax income and may cause variability in our effective tax rate. Our income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $4.2 billion, which included $1.7 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily attributable to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and audit-related developments. Our income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $2.0 billion, which included $3.3 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily attributable to a valuation loss related to our equity investment in Rivian. Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds was $750 million and $742 million in Q3 2021 and Q3 2022, and $3.4 billion and $4.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2022. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, tax contingencies were approximately $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion. Changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years’ tax filings. We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2009 and thereafter. We are currently disputing tax assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including with respect to the allocation and characterization of income. In September 2022, the Luxembourg Tax Authority (“LTA”) denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets that we distributed from Luxembourg to the U.S. in 2021. We believe the LTA’s position is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter."

                "SEGMENT INFORMATION We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Technology and content,” “Sales and marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company’s business performance and manages its operations. North America The North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores. International The International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores. AWS The AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions.
